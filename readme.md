# Rancho Labs MERN Assignment

**Key Elements**

- Grid: 5x5 grid on the screen with a robot on the top left and a red square (end square) at the bottom right.
- Logic Panel: Consists of squares where the arrow buttons below have to be dragged and dropped.

**Task**
The robot inside the grid has to move step-by-step according to the directions provided to it through the logic panel. When clicked on the play button, the robot executes the directions in sequential order according to the directions provided in the logic panel. The robot should return back to its initial position when the reset button is clicked
